Steps to the program:

Take two inputs
The inputs are unique names of two stations, the initial and final station
for reach station input make an array
this array contains every "line" they are a part of
For each line, go to the line arrays, and recursively run through every combination of lines
once you get the shortest combination of lines, just return every intersection point in that sequence
